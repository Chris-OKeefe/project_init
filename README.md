#Data Project Initiator Script

This script creates the following subdirectories within a (new) project directory.
* /build/input
* /build/output
* /build/code
* /build/temp
* /analysis/input
* /analysis/output
* /analysis/code
* /analysis/temp

It also initializes an empty run_directory.sh script and an empty README.md file.

This is in line with the recommendations made by Matthew Gentzkow and Jess Shapiro (2014).
